# Chess in Bevy

This is an implementation of the classic Chess game in the [Bevy](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy) game engine, using the [bevy_mod_picking](https://github.com/aevyrie/bevy_mod_picking/) plugin.

I'm currently writing an accompanying tutorial that I'll link here when I finish writing. Meanwhile, feel free to take a look at the code or run the game yourself!

Here's a recording of the game:
